# 🧱 BequestBlock

BequestBlock is a simple and transparent **inheritance recording smart contract** built using **Solidity**.  
It allows individuals to **immortally store inheritance details** on the blockchain — ensuring that records of who inherits what remain **immutable, public, and tamper-proof**.

---

## 🪙 Project Description

In traditional systems, inheritance documentation can be lost, forged, or disputed.  
**BequestBlock** solves this by leveraging blockchain technology to create a **trustless and permanent record** of inheritance wishes.  
Every entry is securely stored on-chain and cannot be modified once recorded.

---

## 💡 What It Does

- Lets a user (the *owner*) record an inheritance for a chosen *beneficiary*.
- Stores details such as:
  - Owner’s address  
  - Beneficiary’s address  
  - Description of the asset (property, funds, NFT, etc.)  
  - Timestamp of record creation  
- Keeps all data **publicly verifiable and immutable** on the blockchain.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **Immutable Records** – Once stored, inheritance details can’t be altered or deleted.  
✅ **Transparent Access** – Anyone can view the records via blockchain explorers.  
✅ **Beginner-Friendly** – Simple Solidity code and functions for easy understanding.  
✅ **Trustless System** – No third-party or central authority required.  
✅ **Upgradeable Idea** – Can later include time locks, fund transfers, or executors.
